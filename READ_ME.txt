Make sure to have the leap-0.5.0.js file in the same folder as the html file.

How to use:

With >2 fingers extended:
	X axis = Increase/Decrease longitude
	Z axis = Increase/Decrease latitude
	Y axis = Zoom in and out

With <2 fingers extend:
	Only Z axis is enabled = Zoom in and Out
		- For more accurate zooming capabilities without shaking the camera
Placing a pin:
	With your original (first) hand over the sensor to control the globe, place your second hand
	in front of the sensor (with two or more fingers raised) to add a push pin to the center of
	the camera's view.
	
	A prompt will pop up asking for some text (which is not required) so that a label may be
	added next to the pin.
